# Technical Research: Car Rental Frontend

## Frontend Framework
**Decision**: React with TypeScript
**Rationale**:
- Aligned with constitution requirements
- TypeScript provides strong typing and better developer experience
- Minimal external dependencies as per requirements
**Alternatives considered**:
- Vue.js - Not chosen as React was specified in requirements
- Angular - Too heavy for our minimal library approach

## State Management
**Decision**: React Context + useState/useReducer
**Rationale**:
- Keeps dependencies minimal
- Sufficient for our application's complexity
- Native React solution without external libraries
**Alternatives considered**:
- Redux - Too heavy for our needs
- MobX - Additional dependency not required
- Zustand - While lightweight, native React state is sufficient

## Styling Approach
**Decision**: CSS Modules with modern CSS features
**Rationale**:
- No additional dependencies
- Scoped styling prevents conflicts
- Modern CSS features (Grid, Flexbox, Custom Properties) provide all needed capabilities
**Alternatives considered**:
- Styled-components - Additional dependency
- Tailwind - Would add complexity and build setup
- Sass - Additional preprocessing step not needed

## API Integration
**Decision**: Native fetch API with TypeScript types
**Rationale**:
- Built into browsers
- No additional dependencies
- TypeScript types provide compile-time safety
**Alternatives considered**:
- Axios - Additional dependency not needed
- React Query - Too feature-rich for our simple needs

## Component Structure
**Decision**: Feature-based organization with shared components
**Rationale**:
- Separates concerns clearly
- Makes code navigation intuitive
- Promotes reusability
**Structure**:
```
src/
├── components/          # Shared components
│   ├── common/         # Basic UI components
│   └── layout/         # Layout components
├── features/           # Feature-specific components
│   ├── cars/          # Car listing related
│   └── reservations/  # Reservation related
├── services/          # API integration
├── utils/             # Shared utilities
└── types/            # TypeScript types
```

## Image Management
**Decision**: Local static images with TypeScript imports
**Rationale**:
- Simple to implement
- Fast loading
- Version controlled
**Image Structure**:
```
public/
└── images/
    └── cars/
        ├── sedan/
        ├── suv/
        └── van/
```
