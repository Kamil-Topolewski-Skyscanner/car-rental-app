# Feature Specification: Modern Car Rental System

**Feature Branch**: `001-car-reservation-system`
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Building a modern car rental website with sleek design. System requirements: Allow reservation of cars by type (Sedan, SUV, van) at desired date/time for specific duration. Limited inventory per car type."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Browse Available Cars (Priority: P1)

As a potential customer, I want to browse available car types and see their availability so that I can make an informed rental decision.

**Why this priority**: Essential first step for any rental process; users need to know what's available before making a reservation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to the car listing page and verifying that all car types are displayed with their details and availability status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the homepage, **When** I view the car listings, **Then** I should see all three car types (Sedan, SUV, and Van) with their images and descriptions
2. **Given** I am viewing car listings, **When** I select a specific date range, **Then** I should see the availability status for each car type
3. **Given** a car type has no available units, **When** I view the listings, **Then** I should see that type marked as "unavailable" for the selected dates

### User Story 2 - Make Car Reservation (Priority: P1)

As a customer, I want to reserve a car of my chosen type for specific dates so that I can secure my rental in advance.

**Why this priority**: Core business functionality that enables revenue generation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by completing a reservation flow and verifying the booking is recorded.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I've selected a car type with availability, **When** I enter valid rental dates and submit the reservation, **Then** I should receive a confirmation
2. **Given** I attempt to book a car, **When** I select dates where no cars are available, **Then** I should see an appropriate message and alternative dates
3. **Given** I'm making a reservation, **When** I submit the booking form, **Then** the inventory count for that car type should decrease

### User Story 3 - Dynamic Availability Calendar (Priority: P2)

As a customer, I want to see a calendar showing available dates for my preferred car type so that I can easily plan my rental.

**Why this priority**: Enhances user experience but not critical for MVP as availability can be shown in other ways.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by interacting with the calendar component and verifying date availability displays.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I'm viewing a specific car type, **When** I open the availability calendar, **Then** I should see available dates highlighted
2. **Given** I'm using the calendar, **When** I hover over different dates, **Then** I should see the number of available cars for those dates

### Edge Cases

- What happens when multiple users try to book the last available car simultaneously?
- How does the system handle reservation requests spanning multiple availability periods?
- What happens when a user attempts to modify a reservation to dates with no availability?
- How does the system handle timezone differences for international bookings?
