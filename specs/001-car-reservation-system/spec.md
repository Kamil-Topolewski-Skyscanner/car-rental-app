# Feature Specification: Modern Car Rental System

**Feature Branch**: `001-car-reservation-system`
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Building a modern car rental website with sleek design. System requirements: Allow reservation of cars by type (Sedan, SUV, van) at desired date/time for specific duration. Limited inventory per car type."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Browse and Reserve Available Cars (Priority: P1)

As a potential customer, I want to browse available car types, select my rental dates, and make reservations efficiently.

**Why this priority**: Essential first step for any rental process; users need to know what's available before making a reservation and select their desired dates upfront.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to the car listing page, selecting dates, and verifying that car availability and reservation options update accordingly.

**Date Selection Placement and Design**:
- Compact, low-profile date picker section below header
- Maximum width of 600px centered on the page
- Height: Maximum 80px (reduced from standard height)
- Minimal padding: 0.75rem (reduced from 1.5rem)
- Horizontally arranged date fields with optimized spacing
- Should remain visible and accessible while browsing
- Selected dates affect availability status and reservation options

**Header Design**:
- Slim, modern header with blue-to-black gradient background
- Height: Maximum 70px (reduced from standard height)
- Gradient: From #2C5282 (deep blue) to #1A202C (near black)
- Compact vertical padding: 0.75rem (reduced from 2rem)
- White text with optimized font sizes for smaller height
- Subtle shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)
- Fixed position with z-index to stay above content

**Date Selection Behavior**:
- Start Date defaults to today
- End Date defaults to tomorrow
- Cannot select dates in the past
- End Date must be after Start Date
- Maximum rental period is 30 days
- Date changes should immediately update car availability

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the homepage, **When** I view the car listings, **Then** I should see all three car types (SEDAN, SUV, and VAN) with their images and descriptions
2. **Given** I am viewing car listings, **When** I select a specific date range, **Then** I should see the availability status for each car type
3. **Given** a car type has no available units, **When** I view the listings, **Then** I should see that type marked as "unavailable" for the selected dates
4. **Given** I am viewing car listings, **When** I look at the filter options, **Then** I should see exactly three filter pills: SEDAN, SUV, and VAN
5. **Given** I click on a filter pill (SEDAN, SUV, or VAN), **When** the filter is applied, **Then** I should only see cars of that specific type
6. **Given** I am on the car listing page, **When** I first load the page, **Then** I should see the date picker with today and tomorrow as default dates
7. **Given** I am viewing the car listings, **When** I change the date range in the date picker, **Then** the availability of all cars should update immediately
8. **Given** I am selecting dates, **When** I try to select invalid dates (past dates or end before start), **Then** I should be prevented from doing so and see an error message
9. **Given** I have selected valid dates, **When** I click "Reserve" on an available car, **Then** the reservation should be created using my pre-selected dates
10. **Given** I have selected dates that make a car unavailable, **When** I view that car's card, **Then** its "Reserve" button should be disabled and show "Unavailable for selected dates"
11. **Given** I navigate away from the car listing page, **When** I return to it, **Then** my previously selected dates should still be there

### User Story 2 - Make Car Reservation (Priority: P1)

As a customer, I want to reserve a car of my chosen type for specific dates so that I can secure my rental in advance.

**Why this priority**: Core business functionality that enables revenue generation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by completing a reservation flow and verifying the booking is recorded.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I've selected a car type with availability, **When** I enter valid rental dates and submit the reservation, **Then** I should receive a confirmation
2. **Given** I attempt to book a car, **When** I select dates where no cars are available, **Then** I should see an appropriate message and alternative dates
3. **Given** I'm making a reservation, **When** I submit the booking form, **Then** the inventory count for that car type should decrease
4. **Given** I've successfully completed a reservation, **When** the reservation is confirmed, **Then** I should see a confirmation modal with:
   - Reservation ID
   - Car type
   - Start date and time
   - Duration
   - Total price
   - Confirmation message

---

### User Story 3 - Dynamic Availability Calendar (Priority: P2)

As a customer, I want to see a calendar showing available dates for my preferred car type so that I can easily plan my rental.

**Why this priority**: Enhances user experience but not critical for MVP as availability can be shown in other ways.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by interacting with the calendar component and verifying date availability displays.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I'm viewing a specific car type, **When** I open the availability calendar, **Then** I should see available dates highlighted
2. **Given** I'm using the calendar, **When** I hover over different dates, **Then** I should see the number of available cars for those dates

### Edge Cases

- What happens when multiple users try to book the last available car simultaneously?
- How does the system handle reservation requests spanning multiple availability periods?
- What happens when a user attempts to modify a reservation to dates with no availability?
- How does the system handle timezone differences for international bookings?
- What happens when the reservation service is temporarily unavailable?
- How should the system handle API errors or timeouts from the reservation service?
